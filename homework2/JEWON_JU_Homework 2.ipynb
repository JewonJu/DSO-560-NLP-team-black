So we wait about 5 - 10 minutes for our turn to order. We order the specials they were having at that time (20 pcs chicken nuggets for $5) and asked for a cup of water because we didn't want to drink any sodas at that late hour. They take our order but tells us they don't serve cups of water there. So we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order.

This is primarily because they are so slow. My gosh what exactly is the hold up? It's FAST food people. Also, this morning, I guess the worker thought his mic was off, but it wasn't. I now know that he is trying to get as many hours as possible because he needs money BAD. Spread the word. Anyway, this location is on a little access road and you have to go back the way you came because there is no exit from it at the other end. It would have helped if there was one. So, in the end I think I'll avoid this location and find another. This should be easy as there is no shortage of Mickey D's in this piece.   \n",

I blame management. last day of free coffee so \"we\" decide to stop and order breakfast and coffees thru drive-thru. She charged us for coffee and when asked why she said she needed to confirm there were two of us in the car. Now she has to clear the order and that took retraining. Ask next time at tthe speaker.Oh it gets better....We get to next window where Einstein is waiting, pours the coffees with different creams/sugars added. \"Which one is which?\" I asked... and he smiled and said \"One has 2 cream 2 sugar and the other has 3 cream 1 sugar\".. didnt maek the cups... but at least he made sure we had straws for our coffees.... Hello? management? Where are You?   \n",
       "8  Never been upset about any fast food drive thru service till I came to this McDonalds.After a long trip from California my wife and I went to McDonalds for a quick bite to eat before our drive back home. We pull up to the drive thru but there are a lot of cars waiting to order. We were guessing there must be a lot demand for McDonalds at this late hour. So we wait about 5 - 10 minutes for our turn to order. We order the specials they were having at that time (20 pcs chicken nuggets for $5) and asked for a cup of water because we didn't want to drink any sodas at that late hour. They take our order but tells us they don't serve cups of water there. So we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order. However, we wait for almost another 10 min to finally pay at the first window - then another 5 more min to finally receive our food. By far the worst McDonalds in the world. Unfriendly and slow.   \n",

Usually my order would be wrong every single time so I would not leave that window until I checked every single item. I only hit up fast food once a month or so and it needs to be worth it. Also the fries used to be cold and the cheese on the burger was never melted. Everything was just lukewarm. Now my order has been right a few times in a row and my food hot. Also, I love dining room. Usually you wouldn't find me actually inside a fast food joint but this place has nice flooring, stacked stone, lots of large windows and a flat screen TV usually on HLN. Sometimes its nice to sneak away for a quick weekend breakfast, you know, a little budget and time friendly mommy and me date.   \n",

This is by far the worst one I've ever been too! It's filthy inside and if you get drive through they completely screw up your order every time! The staff is terribly unfriendly and nobody seems to care.   \n",

I came in at 9:30pm and stood in front of the register and no one bothered to say anything or help me for 5 minutes. There was no one else waiting for their food inside either, just outside at the window.  I left and went to Chickfila next door and was greeted before I was all the way inside. This McDonalds is also dirty, the floor was covered with dropped food. Obviously filled with surly and unhappy workers.   \n",

This review reflects solely on the poor service. I have been to this location countless times over the years. They consistently fail on the service end of things. The order takers tend to be rude, no smiles, and a lot of \"sighs\" and \"lip smacking\" when you talk to them. So why go back you ask? This store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area. The next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town. Also I strongly believe in 2nd chances and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100% of the time. I have given them many chances at earning a positive review. I could not recommend this location any less. If you can wait, take a pass. There are better McDonald's stores in Griffin, GA.   \n",

This is primarily because they are so slow. My gosh what exactly is the hold up? It's FAST food people. Also, this morning, I guess the worker thought his mic was off, but it wasn't. I now know that he is trying to get as many hours as possible because he needs money BAD. Spread the word. Anyway, this location is on a little access road and you have to go back the way you came because there is no exit from it at the other end. It would have helped if there was one. So, in the end I think I'll avoid this location and find another. This should be easy as there is no shortage of Mickey D's in this piece.   \n",

I blame management. last day of free coffee so \"we\" decide to stop and order breakfast and coffees thru drive-thru. She charged us for coffee and when asked why she said she needed to confirm there were two of us in the car. Now she has to clear the order and that took retraining. Ask next time at tthe speaker.Oh it gets better....We get to next window where Einstein is waiting, pours the coffees with different creams/sugars added. \"Which one is which?\" I asked... and he smiled and said \"One has 2 cream 2 sugar and the other has 3 cream 1 sugar\".. didnt maek the cups... but at least he made sure we had straws for our coffees.... Hello? management? Where are You?   \n",
       "8  Never been upset about any fast food drive thru service till I came to this McDonalds.After a long trip from California my wife and I went to McDonalds for a quick bite to eat before our drive back home. We pull up to the drive thru but there are a lot of cars waiting to order. We were guessing there must be a lot demand for McDonalds at this late hour. So we wait about 5 - 10 minutes for our turn to order. We order the specials they were having at that time (20 pcs chicken nuggets for $5) and asked for a cup of water because we didn't want to drink any sodas at that late hour. They take our order but tells us they don't serve cups of water there. So we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order. However, we wait for almost another 10 min to finally pay at the first window - then another 5 more min to finally receive our food. By far the worst McDonalds in the world. Unfriendly and slow.   \n",

Usually my order would be wrong every single time so I would not leave that window until I checked every single item. I only hit up fast food once a month or so and it needs to be worth it. Also the fries used to be cold and the cheese on the burger was never melted. Everything was just lukewarm. Now my order has been right a few times in a row and my food hot. Also, I love dining room. Usually you wouldn't find me actually inside a fast food joint but this place has nice flooring, stacked stone, lots of large windows and a flat screen TV usually on HLN. Sometimes its nice to sneak away for a quick weekend breakfast, you know, a little budget and time friendly mommy and me date.   \n",

Not every meal can be a 5 star dinner with an executive chef.Even with appropriate low expectations, this location takes the cake for subpar service. About a week ago I was exhausted and needed something to eat and there are few fast food restaurants near where I live. So off to McDonalds I went. Ordered a value meal and a single apple pie. Surprise...no pie! Ok, mistakes happen. I've worked drive through in a previous life and I get it. Even though it was 10 pm and I was the only car there, so it's not like they were rushed. Still...mistakes happen.Fast forward to tonight. Again about 10 pm and exhausted and decide to go crazy and get McD's twice in 1 week. So I try again to order an apple pie with my value meal. Now, maybe this is my fault, because I should have checked the bag before driving off. But after sitting at the window and waiting for 5 minutes (and remember, I was really tired), silly me thought they'd be able to get it straight this time.Turns out I was wrong. Yet again...no pie. Both times (within a week of each other) I paid for them. Neither time they felt it necessary to put it in the actual bag.So I called to talk to the manager. And get hung up on as soon as I ask for the manager. So I called back, the manager actually answered and I told him what happened. He didn't sound too displeased, just told me \"next time we'll get your order right.\"Yeah, if there IS a next time.</td>\n",

Getting right down to it. I was out running by a few client sites today when I stopped and picked up lunch at Riverside (that's right, be jealous). So, a coworker calls and asks if I would pick up lunch for her. Being a team player I said no problem. She then told me she wanted Satan...I mean McDonalds. I sighed, but agreed. She told me what she wanted and off I went. Oh and to get some ketchup and Sweet and Sour sauce. Mkay. I pulled up to the drive thru and ordered after they tried to sell me their new Angus Burger. (Sidenote: Why do they do that in the first place? I mean, if that is what I wanted, I would have ordered it.) \"May I please have #12 with a Sprite.\" \"Would you l like to add on an apple pie for $.50?\" \"Um, no.\" \"$7.01, please pull up to the first window.\" So I pay. Drive to window #2. Man opens the window hands me the drink and the bag of food. I asked for a S&amp;S Sauce packet. The guy responded. \"We charge for that now.\" \"Ha, that's hilarious. Just one please.\" \"No really, they are $.28\" \"What? You're kidding right?\" \"No ma'am, if you want one you'll have to pull back around the drive thru.\" (Totally dumbfounded I say) \"Do you charge for ketchup too?\" Then drive off. I laugh the entire way back to work like a crazy woman...\"What do you mean your charging for condiments? \" \"Is it laced with heroin?\" \"Are there diamonds inside these packets?\" \"Is charging for this even legal?\" I mean it wasn't even my order and I'm mad as hell. They've managed to piss me off again. Congrats McSatan. You officially suck more than ever. Take your Sweet and Sour Sauce and shove it where the sun don't shine. *spits on ground*</td>\n",

So let's say expectations are very, very low. Sometimes though you just want food that's fast and you know what to expect. Not every meal can be a 5 star dinner with an executive chef.Even with appropriate low expectations, this location takes the cake for subpar service. About a week ago I was exhausted and needed something to eat and there are few fast food restaurants near where I live. So off to McDonalds I went. Ordered a value meal and a single apple pie. Surprise...no pie! Ok, mistakes happen. I've worked drive through in a previous life and I get it. Even though it was 10 pm and I was the only car there, so it's not like they were rushed. Still...mistakes happen.Fast forward to tonight. Again about 10 pm and exhausted and decide to go crazy and get McD's twice in 1 week. So I try again to order an apple pie with my value meal. Now, maybe this is my fault, because I should have checked the bag before driving off. But after sitting at the window and waiting for 5 minutes (and remember, I was really tired), silly me thought they'd be able to get it straight this time.Turns out I was wrong. Yet again...no pie. Both times (within a week of each other) I paid for them. Neither time they felt it necessary to put it in the actual bag.So I called to talk to the manager. And get hung up on as soon as I ask for the manager. So I called back, the manager actually answered and I told him what happened. He didn't sound too displeased, just told me \"next time we'll get your order right.\"Yeah, if there IS a next time.   \n",
       "534   I know what your thinking....\"another 1 star review for McD's and you don't even eat there?!? What gives?\" Well I have to say this is an \"informative\" review! Getting right down to it. I was out running by a few client sites today when I stopped and picked up lunch at Riverside (that's right, be jealous). So, a coworker calls and asks if I would pick up lunch for her. Being a team player I said no problem. She then told me she wanted Satan...I mean McDonalds. I sighed, but agreed. She told me what she wanted and off I went. Oh and to get some ketchup and Sweet and Sour sauce. Mkay. I pulled up to the drive thru and ordered after they tried to sell me their new Angus Burger. (Sidenote: Why do they do that in the first place? I mean, if that is what I wanted, I would have ordered it.) \"May I please have #12 with a Sprite.\" \"Would you l like to add on an apple pie for $.50?\" \"Um, no.\" \"$7.01, please pull up to the first window.\" So I pay. Drive to window #2. Man opens the window hands me the drink and the bag of food. I asked for a S&S Sauce packet. The guy responded. \"We charge for that now.\" \"Ha, that's hilarious. Just one please.\" \"No really, they are $.28\" \"What? You're kidding right?\" \"No ma'am, if you want one you'll have to pull back around the drive thru.\" (Totally dumbfounded I say) \"Do you charge for ketchup too?\" Then drive off. I laugh the entire way back to work like a crazy woman...\"What do you mean your charging for condiments? \" \"Is it laced with heroin?\" \"Are there diamonds inside these packets?\" \"Is charging for this even legal?\" I mean it wasn't even my order and I'm mad as hell. They've managed to piss me off again. Congrats McSatan. You officially suck more than ever. Take your Sweet and Sour Sauce and shove it where the sun don't shine. *spits on ground*   \n",

Not sure if its just this location or all McDonalds, anything with mayonnaise will have enough mayo for three sandwiches and enough bread for almost 6 sandwiches compared to the amount of meat. If you request mustard instead of mayonnaise make sure you ask for mustard at the second window because you're getting dry sandwiches.   \n",

Rude and indifferent manager. My friends and I go there to purchase food and I asked for a courtesy cup of water as it was very hot and I didn't want soda. She looked me square in the eye in front of everyone and said \"no\". That will cost you $.27 cents. Not even after I had patronized the business could I not have a sip of water? Really? I will never shop at that McDonald's ever again. Any McDonalds really. I actually watched the manager and she treated every minority who walked in like crap.   \n",

Ordered a Big Mac the other day and the sandwich looked like someone sat on it.I've seen better quality of sandwiches from other locations in Dallas.   \n",

The staff are as dumb as rocks, slow, can't understand them when trying to place an order. Oh, and usually between this time it's \"Cash only\" because for some reason it takes 3 or more hours to batch out their credit card machine. Not to mention the wait time. One time it took over 10 minutes for my sweet tea and fruit & yogurt parfait. Terrible service all around, don't let it's \"fancy\" interior fool you.   \n",

The food was good, fast as always but I don't know why they took forever to brew up a pot of coffee plus they forgot I had ordered it (probably because the manager and all the employees were chatting and not paying attention to customers). The indoor play area could use a little cleaning up.   \n",

I've been through the drive thru for breakfast a couple of times. The only thing to really note is they have two places you can order from in the drive thru. Don't be an idiot and sit at the first one for too long with out moving to the next one to order, like I did. Doh. Otherwise enjoy!   \n",

Why? Because you mess something up every single time I go there. Why do I keep going there? Because it is the closest thing to my work in the morning for a quick breakfast. Now, I'll just have to get something closer to my house and eat in the car BECAUSE OF HOW TERRIBLE YALL ARE. You have one job...one SUPER EASY JOB. Take my order, take my money, put my order in the bag and make sure it is correct. When I get to the window and ask \"Did you remember the Honey Mustard\" nicely. and you give me this smirk of \"Heck yes I did\", well that is just fantastic, because you guys always forget the sauces I ASK AND PAY FOR. But, this one time you remember. Thats not the part I'm complaining about. I'm complaining because you remembered my Honey Mustard, but forgot my 2 hash browns! I shouldn't have to check my bag at the window when I receive my order. That is just absurd. HOW HARD IS IT TO GET AN ORDER RIGHT WHEN IT IS JUST 2 HASHBROWNS AND HONEY MUSTARD. How much money do they make ezra by saving food and \"forgetting\" your food even though you pay. Then once we check we are long gone and too far to even turn around and WAIST OUR TIME to get our order right. Pathetic place, you will always stay minimum wage because the simplest of things you can NOT complete. I don't care if it is just a Mcdonalds. It's a business that makes thousands of dollars a day. DO IT RIGHT. If I could give this negative stars I would. I wish I could travel back in time, and build something in the lot of this McDonalds, just so I would know this place would never exist here.   \n",

The workers are always friendly and welcome you as you walk into the door! The first time I walked into this store I was shocked! The store has chandeliers and antiques and art on the walls. It looks more like a five star restaurant that a fast food joint! The bathrooms even have gold plated fixtures!It's still McDonalds so the food is the same as everywhere else but the employees and atmosphere makes it a pleasant experience.   \n",

You can just tell he was about one more \"Would you like it Super Sized,\" away from completely going postal. I had the pleasure of running into him twice during my entire stay (what can i say? i like Mcdonald's.). Our second encounter was the weirdest. He started like mouthing something weird to me.

So Kudos for being the closest open 24 hour McDs to me.However, if you do come, take notice of the giant CPD HQ building that is just a few blocks west of this place. IF ANYTHING was to go down, hurry to this refuge of safety.This following rant is not on this specific location but on McDs in general. What the hell is a friggin' McDouble and why is it replacing the double cheeseburger for 99c? A McDouble is a fancy way of saying \"we jacked yo cheeze, foo!\" It is a double cheeseburger with only 1 slice of cheese. 1 tiny slice of cheese is not enough to satisfy my cheeseburger craving!!!! I guess I'm too poor to be more than a Dolla Menunaire cuz I can no longer afford a double cheeseburger at $1.29 and I can only get the 99c McDouble.\n",

The lady told me to go back to the front and wait 10 minutes I told her I've been waiting for 18 minutes. They so slow!!! And probably not even doing their job. I own the business across the street and they always waste my time. Today, I asked for that Oreo mcflurry I think and they said \"Yes\" they have some so it's cool, then when I went to pay, they told me \"I'm sorry we don't have some at the moment and we will refund your money and you can take the rest of your order at the 2nd window\" ~__~ whoever the manager here for sure doesn't know how to manage.

WTF????). Cars were honking ferociously behind me. now i'm blocked in. low and behold when i move up, i recognize the guy handing me my food as one of the mcdonald's workers who stepped over my pile of food in slow-motion matrix effect yesterday morning. ughhh! guess they're probably hiring at this fast food establishment and will take any dreggs off the street who either has a pulse or a trust fund, so what's the hurry? Gave them a 2nd chance, learned my lesson, won't ever go back.

McDonalds has the best kids meals and playplaces so for my seven year old this is a great place. Love the apple slices and much smaller fry bags for the kids.The sundays are good and the recently added smoothies are great. Very disappointed in the new popcorn style chicken. It is worse than KFC's popcorn chicken was before they made larger pieces. In fact, most of my box was just fried coating with little or no chicken.  As fast food places go, I find McDonalds the most consistent in quality and taste. I love their breakfasts and the chicken nuggets are still the best. Avoid the angus burgers. They are not as good as advertized.\n",

A \"Hello good evening.\" Or \"sorry for the wait,\" SOMETHING that lets me feel a lil better for spending my HARD EARNED cash at this establishment! Anyone that works retail knows how much CUSTOMER SEVICE IS PUSHED. Management at this McDonalds should consider retraining & teach these employees the basics. Working with the public, being a cashier isn't easy, You deal with unsavory people with crappier attitudes sometimes. BUT, you still want your customers to leave happier, not upset.\n",

      "80.3% Normally I don't review a chain unless something about that particular location stands out, good or bad.This location for some reason, has the most ridiculous service I've ever encountered. It's McDonalds you say, what do you expect? Not much, really but let me tell you...ENCOUNTER #1I ordered 10-piece chicken nuggets, fries, and unsweetened ice tea. I got the nuggets and tea. I went up to the counter, placed my receipt on the counter gently faced away from me, and said \"I'm sorry, I --\" Before I finished my sentence, the employee SLAMMED her hand on my receipt on the counter and dragged it towards her. Um... WTF?!I didn't know how to react because she looked at my receipt and threw it away without addressing me. I went \"um...ok...\" and backed away from the counter to fill my tea. I have no clue what I did to piss this employee off but my friend who came with me, asked me what the heck happened. I said \"I have no clue, I'm just missing my fries...\" My friend was nice and *itchy enough to go up to the counter, grab the attention of a different employee and told him we were missing our fries.But honestly, what is wrong with you? I'm SORRY you were having a bad day but that doesn't excuse you from taking it out on a customer who was trying to be nice about an honest mistake that can be easily fixed. Not a big deal, I paid for fries and I have an incomplete order. So chill, geez.---------ENCOUNTER #23 friends and I came here for smoothies. One of my friends ordered a big mac, nuggets and fries. Everyone else got our orders. My friend waited 20 minutes for his order to be done. No lie, we looked at the time on the receipt.You're thinking, um yea maybe they were cooking it. No...In that 20 minutes, we saw 5 employees goofing off, bickering with each other, throwing towels at each other, and basically... being extremely unprofessional. They didn't even do this in the back were customers cant see, they did this all in front of us, just on the other side of the counter. Based on the manager's asking where the order is, they seem to have forgotten about the order.I don't care if you do this at work, but can you do this when no one is waiting for their food? It's really awkward to be standing and waiting while watching you goof off AND have your manager ask the team where our order is... THREE times.I really felt embarrassed for the manager because this just reflects badly on him but he really should be more assertive and keep his team in check. For his credit, he did give us a coupon for a free dessert of our choice...which honestly is nothing because I dont ever order a pie, cone, or sundae.oh and our smoothies were not filled all the way to the top... mine was 75% full.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "77.5% The worst service ever. And I'm not a rude person, at all. I said \"please\" and \"thank you.\" And I absolutely was not greeted whatsoever. Whoever that dumbass lady was, that was working needs to take that stick out of her. Don't be mad at me 'cause you hate YOUR job, bitch. Let's not forget that everyone is REPLACEABLE, including your miserable self. It took every bit of me not to cuss her out. I'd write a letter to corporate but she did not give me a receipt. Go figure right. I'm not one to talk down on people that works fast food because it's not in my character to knock someone's hustle. But she really needs to get it together. And for that, I will NOT ever return to this McDonald's ever again. Some bullshit. Oh. And. Not only did I not get a receipt... I didn't get a straw. And instead of 10 piece chicken nuggets, I got 9. What in the fucking fuck..... Fuck that McDonalds.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "75.6% Sometimes you need to let loose...Just don't do it here. Drive thru service is completely horrible. It is slow, workers don't speak English well, order screen is damaged and 9/10 times, there is a homeless person begging at the speaker box and another homeless person begging at the pick-up window. No exaggeration! Everytime, yes, everytime I have gone to this drive-thru, they have screwed up my order. So you'd better check what's in the bag before you drive off. The trick is to find that perfect timing of when to check what's in the bag, how to roll up your window to avoid the homeless beggar and how much time to take to examine your bag's contents without annoying the people behind you who have also been waiting for 20 minutes + in the same drive-thru. This place is horrible.The food taste like McDonald's food...but over-cooked or under-cooked. It is never just right. Don't bother with the frozen yogurt either. The machine must be faulty because it comes out like a sloppy mess. The food here only taste good if you're drunk but you wouldn't be in the drive thru if you were drunk anyway! ;) I'd rather go to near-by Chano's Mexican Food.I have given this establishment multiple chances to prove me wrong but it has consistently under-delivered. It is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to. I challenge you to experience this review for yourself and you'll be surprised by its' truthful accuracy.Bottom line, I'd rather go hungry than go to this McDonald's. They should pay YOU to eat here. The homeless people only beg here, not eat here...and that's saying something about a place that delivers nothing.See you for dessert...\n",

The line is always long and as said, the place is so slow. Their quality for a bacon egg and cheese biscuit is very low. The best location is Pecos and Bonanza. This one Valle Verde and Paseo Verde is the worst.\n",

It should not take 20 minutes to get fast food. My friend and I ordered fries, a double cheeseburger, and a McDouble. Definitely one of the slowest drive thrus I've experienced but perhaps it was just an off day for them. This McDonalds is also very close to downtown Highland Park, so you can grab a bite to eat at McDonalds and then head to the YOrk or Hermosillo down the road for some drinks!It's located in a quiet neighborhood with not a whole lot of traffic. Can't complain about that!\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Topic 1\n",
      "79.1% This is probably the worst McDonald's ever. It doesn't matter what time of day I go, how many people are waiting in line, or how little I order, I ALWAYS end up spending at least 10 to 15 minutes waiting for my order. This is \"not so fast\" fast food! Some of my favorite visits include: - One person at the registers while the entire lobby started filling up with people. It's been about 25 years since I worked in fast food, but if memory serves me, when you have that many people you're supposed to open another register! Finally a worker who was just standing at the fry station doing nothing asked the manager if he can open another register. - Waiting 25 minutes for an iced coffee during a non-rush time. (Similarly, waiting 25 minutes for an ice cream cone on another occasion.) - Asking for a Shamrock shake and being told they ran out, only to see two be made and delivered to the customers right in front of me. I hate that this is the closest McDonald's to me and I have no choice but to go here. Get your shit together, Logan Square McDonald's, or the scary clown might get you!\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "76.4% This is by far the worst McDonald's I have ever been too. Sure, when I was there it was busy, though it wasn't so busy you couldn't find a seat... Yet there was a mob of people waiting to get food, and they give you a # and you have to wait til your # comes up to get serviced. This is kind of fair, so the people who were there first get served first...... BUUUUUUT all I ordered was a plain old 49 cent ice cream cone because I needed to break a 10. And I think it took at least 20 minutes for me to get a SOFT SERVE ice cream cone. It would have taken someone 15 seconds to pull some ice cream out of the soft serve into a cone and then I would have been out of that mob. While I was in the mob waiting to be served, they called out a # for two ice cream cones OVER AND OVER again. Obviously those people had been waiting so long and were so frustrated that they left and didn't care about the dollar they threw down for the cones. Pathetic. People leaving before receiving food that they paid for. Also, the entire time I was standing there waiting we had a man yelling at us to MOVE TO LEFT... ugh.\n",

      "75.5% I come here often because it is very close. While the people there are very nice and helpful i have the same issue. Every time i order it is ALWAYS wrong. ALWAYS. I ordered a chicken wrap plain no cheese crispy. I get lettuce sauce and grilled. I ordered fries and got apple slices. This is just one of many errors they make. I would not come here again or recomend it. This is the only location that gets my order wrong that many times.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "75.5% I ordered 2 large coffees one with 4 creams and the other black coffee so I can take to my co-worker but b4 leaving I ask for cream & sugar. The manager looked at me & said \"you didn't order any\" I asked again & he said I would need ur receipt & I need to add it to the order on my computer. There were people waiting in line so I told him to forget it. I left very disappointed. They count cream & sugar! Oh, during the evening they only take cash. SNAKES!!\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "75.5% The founder of this local resturaunt lived and went to high school less than a mile from the store. Talk about locally owned! They sell french fries, shakes, and all different types of cheeseburgers. Their logo is a cute golden m. They sell \"kids meals\" so don't be alarmed: its fun for the whole family!They have excellent soft-serve ice cream cones and strange tasting yet authentic cultural salads. I recommend the snack-wraps!\n",

      "79.3% I think it's crazy to write a review for a fast food chain like mcd's here but OMG! This is the WORST micky D's I have ever been to! Corporate should totally come down and reevaluate this place. I have lived in this area for 5+ yrs and I have boycott this mcd! I have NEVER gotten an order right here nor even decent quality of service/food. Granted it is in a good location near the reliant and all...but omg, food is gross, drinks are gross (coffee is watered down, flat soda, not very sweet ''sweet tea''), and horrible service both inside and drive thru. I really suggest and recommend u to STAY AWAY from this place. If u do, prepare for everything to go wrong. Check your items before driving off. Including into ur burger bc the burger may be missing the meat!!There is a mcd off of buffalo speedway attached to a gas station that it decent. The best one in the area is further in 3rd ward, at Old Spanish Trail and Scott. They provide excellent service, they are fast, and precise!Stay away from this, unless you want a headache with your meal.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "77.7% Went through the drive-through for what I was hoping would be a quick coffee this morning. When they gave it to me, it was an iced coffee, even though I asked for it hot. They took it back and had be park to the side to wait for my coffee to be ready. When they brought it out, I drove away, only to discover that the supposedly hot coffee was actually lukewarm at best! I drove back and went inside to get a new one, only to find that it was packed and I had difficulty getting to the front to request a new coffee. The entire experience took about 20 minutes. I'm not hating on the employees here or anything, but it was still a disappointing experience overall. This was probably just a fluke, but I recommend double checking your order before driving away, as well as avoiding this McDonalds on Sunday mornings in general.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "77.7% My friend and I came here to grab a quick bite before heading to the REI Garage Sale. Let's set the stage:EXT McDonald's Drive-Through WindowOrder placed: #3 on the breakfast menu, oatmeal, and a coffee with one cream two sugars. Driver goes to first window pays. Instead of returning the card quickly, the cashier proceeds to have a 3-minute girl-talk with another coworker.Car drives to second window. Driver and passenger watch a dude make instant oatmeal. It appears to take several minutes. Worker disdainfully hands a bag and coffee to the driver. Driver asks passenger (me) to check the order as driving away. No oatmeal inside nor a spoon.Driver parks, walks back in, retrieves said missing items, tiredly gets back in car. Driver happily looks on the coffee, which was not prepared according to order.^Perhaps not a tragedy, but definitely a comedy of errors that tells me not to patronize this McDonald's again.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "77.7% I only come to this location when I go to Nellis AFB and it's never that great. Customer service needs some help, two polite employees does not make up for ten rude ones unfortunately. It's a nightmare going inside and the time it's dirty. I prefer the drive-thru but I can sit there for ever saying hello and no one responds or I'll get a response to wait, not a please at all!!! That makes me kinda angry. I know some would not care but I've worked customer service before and it's not polite when you add a rude tone and attitude on top!!!I don't make it to breakfast often. It's been a long time since I've ordered an Egg McMuffin, so I indulged. I paid $1.19 drink upgrade for a large orange juice and I got a watered down juice so I went they the drive-thru and the lady was rude like I was the picky customer, I only want what I pay for and a little dash of politeness since they get paid for it!!!\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "77.7% I truly never thought that I would write a review about a McDonalds but I guess I am. I hate to say this but you ALWAYS need to check your bags for your food, this goes with every fast food restaurant. This particular location has done an amazing job at really stepping up their game to ensure that they are getting orders right.\n",
