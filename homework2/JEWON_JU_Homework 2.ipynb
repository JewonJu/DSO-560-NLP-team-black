So we wait about 5 - 10 minutes for our turn to order.

I came in at 9:30pm and stood in front of the register and no one bothered to say anything or help me for 5 minutes. There was no one else waiting for their food inside either, just outside at the window.  I left and went to Chickfila next door and was greeted before I was all the way inside. This McDonalds is also dirty, the floor was covered with dropped food. Obviously filled with surly and unhappy workers.   \n",

This review reflects solely on the poor service. I have been to this location countless times over the years. They consistently fail on the service end of things. The order takers tend to be rude, no smiles, and a lot of \"sighs\" and \"lip smacking\" when you talk to them. So why go back you ask? This store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area. The next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town. Also I strongly believe in 2nd chances and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100% of the time. I have given them many chances at earning a positive review. I could not recommend this location any less. If you can wait, take a pass. There are better McDonald's stores in Griffin, GA.   \n",

This is primarily because they are so slow. My gosh what exactly is the hold up? It's FAST food people. Also, this morning, I guess the worker thought his mic was off, but it wasn't. I now know that he is trying to get as many hours as possible because he needs money BAD. Spread the word. Anyway, this location is on a little access road and you have to go back the way you came because there is no exit from it at the other end. It would have helped if there was one. So, in the end I think I'll avoid this location and find another. This should be easy as there is no shortage of Mickey D's in this piece.   \n",

I blame management. last day of free coffee so \"we\" decide to stop and order breakfast and coffees thru drive-thru. She charged us for coffee and when asked why she said she needed to confirm there were two of us in the car. Now she has to clear the order and that took retraining. Ask next time at tthe speaker.Oh it gets better....We get to next window where Einstein is waiting, pours the coffees with different creams/sugars added. \"Which one is which?\" I asked... and he smiled and said \"One has 2 cream 2 sugar and the other has 3 cream 1 sugar\".. didnt maek the cups... but at least he made sure we had straws for our coffees.... Hello? management? Where are You?   \n",
       "8  Never been upset about any fast food drive thru service till I came to this McDonalds.After a long trip from California my wife and I went to McDonalds for a quick bite to eat before our drive back home. We pull up to the drive thru but there are a lot of cars waiting to order. We were guessing there must be a lot demand for McDonalds at this late hour. So we wait about 5 - 10 minutes for our turn to order. We order the specials they were having at that time (20 pcs chicken nuggets for $5) and asked for a cup of water because we didn't want to drink any sodas at that late hour. They take our order but tells us they don't serve cups of water there. So we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order. However, we wait for almost another 10 min to finally pay at the first window - then another 5 more min to finally receive our food. By far the worst McDonalds in the world. Unfriendly and slow.   \n",

Usually my order would be wrong every single time so I would not leave that window until I checked every single item. I only hit up fast food once a month or so and it needs to be worth it. Also the fries used to be cold and the cheese on the burger was never melted. Everything was just lukewarm. Now my order has been right a few times in a row and my food hot. Also, I love dining room. Usually you wouldn't find me actually inside a fast food joint but this place has nice flooring, stacked stone, lots of large windows and a flat screen TV usually on HLN. Sometimes its nice to sneak away for a quick weekend breakfast, you know, a little budget and time friendly mommy and me date.   \n",

Don't know what else to call it! She poked her finger through the plastic cup lids (in the slit made for straws) before inserting straws! What the hell for? Imagine a finger, no gloves, super long nails, painted, and this being inserted into every cup lid before inserting the straw! Why did she need to expose customers to her nails and the shit and germs (nails looked filthy!) underneath? She was using her nails as a tool! The straw can be used to go through the straw slit! No need for a finger nail! FILTHY! I saw this going on inside while the poor folks in drive-thru didn't see this! And the cashier had a bad cold and was wiping his runny nose all over with the back of his hand! What can you expect if the manager herself is filthy and polluting the food! Who knows where her hand'a been?\n",

They consistently fail on the service end of things. The order takers tend to be rude, no smiles, and a lot of \"sighs\" and \"lip smacking\" when you talk to them. So why go back you ask? This store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area. The next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town. Also I strongly believe in 2nd chances and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100% of the time. I have given them many chances at earning a positive review.

The first thing I noticed was that the floor was sticky. (A previous reviewer made a similar comment about the play area.) When I noticed this, I said to myself, \"this isn't right.\" Then when I looked for a place to sit, I spotted all the debris in the seat crevices and the floor. There were also flies in the dining area which I had to repeatedly brush off my food. As for the food, it seemed OK, except, this was the first time ever that I was given cold syrup for my hotcakes at a McDonalds..\n",

Now how is that when they are waiting on their order...hell I was thinking you are holding up the customer and the others waiting.! Anyway finally placed order and was told $1.07, which I paid exact price. Here is where its sad...the cashier did not ring up the soda so therefore I did not get a receipt. I know that she planned to pocket the money, which is sad and bad because eventually that cost will get passed off to customers through price increases. I will not return here because I don't like to feel like I am in someone's \"hood\" and I HATE A THIEF!!! maybe I will call to tell them but then again they probably don't care or maybe even steal themselves. plus I do not eat fast food anyway so no need to waste precious minutes\n",

Hands down this is the slowest McDonald's drive thru I've experienced in Atlanta. Considering this location is close to the airport it would be great if they could simply improve the quality of service. As a lover of Sweet Tea, I was completely turned off by this location when I overheard the drive thru operator joking about how sweet it was a few years ago. She told a few of her associates that it was like \"syrup\" and \"liquid diabetes\". By the time I took my first and only sip, I was on I-285 headed to Perimeter Mall and it tasted like cold syrup! Thank goodness for the McDonald's near Perimeter Mall because they refilled my drink. So the moral to the story is, if you're on Camp Creek Pkwy near the airport, bypass McDonald's and head for Chick-fil-A. #EatMoreChicken\n",

That is fine, except about 15 minutes later I'm still waiting. So I go to check what is going on and end up waiting another 5 minutes.  It appeared I wasn't the only one that had a long wait in drive thru as well.  McWrap - I was disappointed.

I saw the manager filling orders for drive-thru customers using bare hands - no gloves or utensils to pack fries - and this is the weirdest thing ever: she was 'fingering' plastic cup lids!?! Don't know what else to call it! She poked her finger through the plastic cup lids (in the slit made for straws) before inserting straws! What the hell for? Imagine a finger, no gloves, super long nails, painted, and this being inserted into every cup lid before inserting the straw! Why did she need to expose customers to her nails and the shit and germs (nails looked filthy!) underneath? She was using her nails as a tool! The straw can be used to go through the straw slit! No need for a finger nail! FILTHY! I saw this going on inside while the poor folks in drive-thru didn't see this! And the cashier had a bad cold and was wiping his runny nose all over with the back of his hand! What can you expect if the manager herself is filthy and polluting the food! Who knows where her hand'a been?\n",

      "99.2% Customer service is well below par here. I placed my order through the intercom and was told that I'd have to pay in separate transactions if I were to use more than 1 coupon. I expected that and was fine with it up until I got to the window in which one of the girls working the cashier had a problem with me using the coupons and I quote, mentioned, \"I don't give a d*** and a f*** what she wants.\" I never make it a goal to be difficult to other people and I find it very rude, let alone unnecessary, that I received this treatment. It is part of your job's duties to simply put in a customer's order. If you don't like your job, you have no business being there, and there are plenty of job seekers out there who would be more deserving of your position. To top it off, after I left the restaurant, I opened my bag to find out that I didn't receive everything I ordered and paid for.\n",

It's brand new and just opened. The reviews here speak for themselves. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHATSOEVER. they always rush you at drive-thru and never get the meal correct because they are all ignorant fucks who can't speak proper English or don't even know English. They don't even give you time to respond on an order completion. I've dined inside and it was fine, however it was dirty around me on most occasions. But 99% of the time I eat there, MY MEAL IS ALWAYS INCORRECT! Always! It's ridiculous! I found out it's an ongoing problem; especially at this store. The fries are always pre sorted and they are a hot or miss. They are really good or really bad, which is really annoying. The sandwich is the same, sometimes they put fresh dripping meat on the bun and it makes it soggy, which is disgusting. Most of the times the sandwich is just plain incorrect. I've had to call corporate about the poor customer service I've had with employees and several managers at this location; as well as the constant issue of my order being messed up (which is very inconvenient in drive-thru). I'm telling you, go to the next McDonald's. The employees here hate their job and are idiots.\n",

The staff at this location can vary from customer service focused to blatant disregard about anything other than accepting your food order and taking your payment. My last visit was a combination of the two, when I placed my order an the drive thru intercom, the order was taken correctly, total given, thanked and asked to drive around to the window. By the time I got around to the window, the person that was to take my money and give me my food was way more interested in an argument that was going on outside in the parking lot between two young ladies and the two young men they were with.I'll admit that I too paid attention to the fight in the parking lot to make sure it didn't escalate into gunfire with my car sitting center mass of it all. About six months ago, someone told me they got robbed while sitting in the drive thru at this location, but they were there around 2am and my visit was taking place at 6pm, so I wasn't worried about getting robbed as much as I was about getting shot.After making sure that the parking lot was not about to be shot up, he accepted my cash, asked me if I wanted to wait a minuite and get some hot fries. I did, and I did.Sure I'll go back. I love McDonald's fries. 18 of 100\n",

      "100.0% The service at this McDonald's is so bad it's almost comical. Case in point: There was about a two week stretch where I would go to McDonald's every morning before work to get an iced vanilla latte. EVERY day (I kid you not) they got my order wrong and made me a hot latte instead. This would not be a problem, but they questioned me every time if I was sure that was what I ordered. Yes, it even showed it on your fancy digital menu. Then they would ask me to pull up and wait 10 minutes for my order to be corrected. My bf and I went inside once to order and they got his order wrong. The woman just stood there and looked at us when we told her and my bf was like, \"...but I guess I can eat this\". Later when we went up and asked for sauce, she gave us the biggest eyeroll upon seeing us and acted like it was physically painful for her to serve us. These are only a couple of examples of the horrible service we have had, but I guess that's typical for a McDonald's attached to a gas station.\n",

      "100.0% I admit, I'm not a big fan of McDonald's. However, sometimes, nothing hits the spot like their fries and a Diet Coke. What pushes this location over the edge of some others is the staff. They're always super nice whether it's 10am or 10pm. They don't make you repeat your order 18 times and they get it right. They're also generous with the condiments when you ask for them (and even when you don't!). Unlike some fast food places that stop serving milkshakes after a certain hour because they've already cleaned the machine, they'll make you a milkshake up until they close. Service is a huge thing for me so the fact that they're always smiling and ready to help me get my fat fix is what makes me partial to this particular location. It can be a bit of a pain to get into and out of as it's right on Holcomb Bridge Rd, but that's a minor annoyance.\n",

This McDonald's exceeded my expectations. I expected a shoddy McDonald's in one of the Las Vegas valley' s older super centers. Instead, I was eating in a clean and surprisingly cozy McDonald's. I am under the impression that it was recently refurbished. The interior shows off McDonald's history through portraits of the first McDonald's. The booths are extraordinary comfortable for a McDonald's. Disparate from a few Las Vegas Valley Walmart McDonald's, this location offers more breakfast items. Including the egg McMuffin. On my visit, they served me the egg McMahon meal in a short period of time. The coffee was hot. And I left satisfied. Keep in mind that I ate here around 9:45 AM, before the Saturday morning rush. So, I have not seen how this McDonald's is when there is a rush of people.\n",

This place is so pitiful just thinking about it makes me angry. I don't even know where to start! Besides Starbucks and Krispy Kreme this is your only option for late night eats at The Excalibur. Here it goes:Visit #1: Fool me once...shame on you.My husband and I head to the room early our first night in Vegas because we were tired after a long drive. After watching some TV my husband said he wanted a little something from our local McDonalds. I was not really hungry but I was craving a little something sweet so I asked him to get me a McFlurry and to call me and tell me what kind they have. He calls and they have Oreo, M&M, and Butterfinger. YUM! I want Butterfinger I exclaimed! He hangs up and calls back about a minute later to break the news to me that they are out of Butterfinger. That would've been useful info to have when he first asked! So I ended up with Oreo. He comes back and I take a bite of my McFlurry. For those who may not know a McFlurry is soft serve icecream mixed with whatever topping you get. How do you possibly mess that up? Messing up a McFlurry is equal to the stupidity of burning cornflakes! There is no excuse. I took one bite and threw it away. The icecream was warm and the oreo chucks were stale. NASTY! My husband's burger and fries turned out ok at least. Visit #2: Fool me twice....shame on me. After some late night gambling I was hungry and did not feel like searching for late night eats so I ventured into this hell hole again. I figured since I was getting regular food this time it would be ok. The customer service of this place is atrocious. You are pretty much the only 24 hour operation that offers more than donuts and coffee so change your attitude. My husband had a sweet tooth this time and wanted a McFlurry. Dun Dun Dun! I order my food and ask for a Oreo McFlurry and the guy behind the counter proceeds to tell me that the icecream machine is locked. Excuse me? WTF? I call my hubby and tell him and he is most displeased. After two minutes of straight cursing he asks for chocolate chip cookies, they have none. The only had oatmeal raisin which I can only describe is the asshole of cookies. So literally they have no good desserts. So my poor baby goes without what he wants. We are not doughnut fans so Krispy Kreme is not really appealing. After that I was done with that place for good!If you are ok with McDonalds go to the one at The Luxor. You will probably get better service. We should've. If you want something better venture into NYNY into America cafe which is open 24 hours and for the same price you can get some decent food and service.\n",

The first thing I noticed was that the floor was sticky. (A previous reviewer made a similar comment about the play area.) When I noticed this, I said to myself, \"this isn't right.\" Then when I looked for a place to sit, I spotted all the debris in the seat crevices and the floor. There were also flies in the dining area which I had to repeatedly brush off my food.

With so many other dining options in the area, I wonder why they don't pay attention to the reviews and step up their game. Today, I went through the drive thru - which is always the slowest around (average of about 5 mins in line - longest time was 11 minutes). Today was the 4th time in a month that I've been through the drive thru and my order was wrong or incomplete. I'm only one person, how many other people does this happen to.This morning, I went to the drive thru about 6:10am, lucky since I was the only one in line. Placed my order, but could tell the person taking my order was distracted. Got to the payment window, where the person dropped my change on the ground, ugh. Next window, pick up food. Here is the entire conversation: Me: Can I get some Mayonnaise and Salt? MD's: Mayonnaise? (as he is chatting with a co-worker and not listening to me.Me: Yes, Mayonnaise and Salt.MD's: OK. (Still chatting it up with co-worker)MD's: That was Mayonnaise and Jelly?Me: No. Mayonnaise and Salt.UGH!! Pay attention! Needless to say, I got to work and order was incomplete. Frustrated, I got back in my car, drove back to restaurant and went inside. Talked to a manager or assistant (couldn't tell, as they had no nametag), but they were very uninterested in the fact that a customer had an issue. I explained that it had happened 4 times in last month, still no reaction. No concern, NO APOLOGY.  He proceeded to get my other item, but was not going to replace the current one I brought back. Since it was now a cold item, I had to ask to get a replacement.I mentioned again that this is the 4th time in a month that this had happened to just me, but again, no apology, no concern, and no reaction. Worst customer service of any restaurant I've ever been in. It seems to me that they need to be reading these reviews and try to improve.

In food quality and employee humanity/work effortTypically, I do NOT eat McDonalds food; yet similar to the experience of others \"trapped\" at Northside Hospital there is no other option if you are hungry outside of the hospital cafeteria hours of operation. Due to a relatives stay and my visits/overnights for 11 weeks~ I too found myself \"trapped\" and therefore forced to buy at McDonalds. Mostly my visits were for coffee or ice cream sundaes. However, last night, for the first time I ordered food (grilled chicken salad) I returned it ~ the meat smelled BADLY. This did not surprise me and only enforced my resolve to avoid chain food restaurants.What did surprise me and absolutely SHOCKED me was the customer service offered by employees ~ HOW in the world can you BE an employee here and NOT for ONE MINUTE or even a second acknowledge the obvious FACT that you work inside a HOSPITAL; then consider what that means for each and every person that approaches your counter to order. HOW you do not SEE them, in FACT that you easily DISMISS them, is beyond my comprehension to understand! HOW you lost your sense of humanity, in all honestly should cause you to pause and contemplate this ~ Are you not aware that you are reflecting how YOU measure within YOU your own sense of dignity?Within my and family/friends of patient at Northside Hospital for the past 11 weeks: each and every time I/they had to place an order I /they was/were subjected to McDonalds toxic business model (in food) which now has transferred (we learned) into their employees. NOT once was I thanked for giving my order; NOT ONCE was I thanked when delivered my order. Yet, at EVERY visit I WAITED and witnessed employee behaviors that were readily displayed and relayed in body language, effort toward actual work, and obvious attitude not only toward me, but guests in front of me. God forbid I happened to have question in reference to the menu (employee response: blank stare, shrug, looking behind them at menu only to turn back around with a blank stare and/or shrug again). God forbid, on separate occasions I happened to ask for a spoon/napkin/straw. Last night, I happened to ask for my drink please (after receiving my salad and waiting for longer than normal) YIKES, you think I had asked him to draw blood!***One more detail regardless if I arrive at 2am, 4am or between 7:30 pm ~ 11 pm this McDonalds is ALWAYS consistently FILTHY! Not just dirty, but FILTHY!Can anyone lift a broom to sweep up the garbage in the service/cooking area; also in the dining room?Can anyone clean the crud surrounding the plastic display case for cookies ALREADY? It's been 11 weeks and that crud is STILL smeared dried; just gross.Wash/disinfect the countertops, payment pads, straw holders, everywhere spills occur; including areas customers touch. EVERY HOUR! Get it? Every single hour! GET a cleaning ONLY employee! This employee will do NOTHING but be THE OCD employee you NEED! Just stop this ATROCIOUSLY DIRTY & DISGUSTING feeding trough you call a restaurant. You should be ashamed.**************************************************Î_**************************************Northside Hospital ~ YOU are responsible for allowing this restaurant to wallow within your walls! How many more years will you ignore not only the unhealthy food options McDonalds supplies~ but to continue to ALLOW a daily dose of DELIBERATE and DILIGENT unhealthy, negative, and \"put upon\" attitudes from employees, to be delivered to family, friends and employees that are there only because they CARE and are there for YOUR patients! HOW this does NOT cause you to react and ACT is beyond me.In my world, with SO MANY options available, this place would be GONE ~ like TODAY; certainly NOT any longer than tomorrow!This toxic waste site is dumping daily doses of negativity, inhumanity~ its seeping and reverberating within the walls of this hospital.

So we wait about 5 - 10 minutes for our turn to order. We order the specials they were having at that time (20 pcs chicken nuggets for $5) and asked for a cup of water because we didn't want to drink any sodas at that late hour. They take our order but tells us they don't serve cups of water there. So we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order. However, we wait for almost another 10 min to finally pay at the first window - then another 5 more min to finally receive our food. By far the worst McDonalds in the world. Unfriendly and slow.\n",

      "100.0% The drive thru makes them lost a star since my last review.This is one of those two lane drive thrus, and I know that the function of that is so that the orders are not messed up when you get to the window, but almost everytime, the cashier ends up asking me what did I order. I inquired about that before and was told, that when someone drives off that messes up the order.Well, I guess there's no controlling drive off, and at least I know my order has been confirmed, so it should be right by the time I get to the second window.This McDonald's, also has a late night drive thru Thur - Sat, it use to be a 24 hour on those days, but I don't think it is any longer. One of my biggest pet peeves is that the drive thru staff has no smile in their voice. When you are ordering food from the luxury of your vehicle you want to think that the person in charge of taking your order is in good spirits, but not at this location.\n",

Also, this morning, I guess the worker thought his mic was off, but it wasn't. I now know that he is trying to get as many hours as possible because he needs money BAD. Spread the word. Anyway, this location is on a little access road and you have to go back the way you came because there is no exit from it at the other end. It would have helped if there was one. So, in the end I think I'll avoid this location and find another. This should be easy as there is no shortage of Mickey D's in this piece.\n",

The fish sandwich was edible in a square processed fish, round bun, too much tartar sauce sort of way. The french fries were horrible. They were not edible. They were stale and greasy.Just because someone is holding a broom does not mean that they are sweeping. The broom is a prop to make people think they are working while they are socializing with co-workers. They will look at you occasionally while they continue to goof off.

Yeah, I'm doing the drywall up there at the new McDonalds.\" -- Office Space (1999)So what a difference a complete overhaul makes. This location was recently LEVELED and rebuilt - and they did a complete 180 - and when I say that, the building was even rotated by 90 degrees.So this is in an area where most of the streets around it are one way, so it can be confusing to get in and out of - and the previous drive-thru began and ended in different places. Now, they redesigned the place so that it makes more sense and the flow works even better than before - and the previous location was there for 30 years? Wow.The new one is sleek, clean, modern and beautiful. The drive-thru staff was super friendly (I was buying a Sprite for heaven's sake) and both the young lady who took my money and the one who handed me my drink said \"we hope to see you back here again soon.\" That's great service, personable and I would be happy to return (not that I do McD's very often). But I'm more apt to come to this one than any other.\n",

It's brand new and just opened. The reviews here speak for themselves. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHATSOEVER. they always rush you at drive-thru and never get the meal correct because they are all ignorant fucks who can't speak proper English or don't even know English. They don't even give you time to respond on an order completion. I've dined inside and it was fine, however it was dirty around me on most occasions. But 99% of the time I eat there, MY MEAL IS ALWAYS INCORRECT! Always! It's ridiculous! I found out it's an ongoing problem; especially at this store. The fries are always pre sorted and they are a hot or miss. They are really good or really bad, which is really annoying. The sandwich is the same, sometimes they put fresh dripping meat on the bun and it makes it soggy, which is disgusting. Most of the times the sandwich is just plain incorrect. I've had to call corporate about the poor customer service I've had with employees and several managers at this location; as well as the constant issue of my order being messed up (which is very inconvenient in drive-thru). I'm telling you, go to the next McDonald's. The employees here hate their job and are idiots.\n",

Finally made it inside and it was about 5 customers to one cashier. The shift manager made the comment that the car that was waiting needed to be pulled up because they are holding up her line. Now how is that when they are waiting on their order...hell I was thinking you are holding up the customer and the others waiting.! Anyway finally placed order and was told $1.07, which I paid exact price. Here is where its sad...the cashier did not ring up the soda so therefore I did not get a receipt. I know that she planned to pocket the money, which is sad and bad because eventually that cost will get passed off to customers through price increases. I will not return here because I don't like to feel like I am in someone's \"hood\" and I HATE A THIEF!!! maybe I will call to tell them but then again they probably don't care or maybe even steal themselves. plus I do not eat fast food anyway so no need to waste precious minutes\n",

I should have taken 2 minutes to read the reviews before I went here and it would have stopped me from ever going. you would think after all that time, at least the food would be hot.

Don't know what else to call it! She poked her finger through the plastic cup lids (in the slit made for straws) before inserting straws! What the hell for? Imagine a finger, no gloves, super long nails, painted, and this being inserted into every cup lid before inserting the straw! Why did she need to expose customers to her nails and the shit and germs (nails looked filthy!) underneath? She was using her nails as a tool! The straw can be used to go through the straw slit! No need for a finger nail! FILTHY! I saw this going on inside while the poor folks in drive-thru didn't see this! And the cashier had a bad cold and was wiping his runny nose all over with the back of his hand! What can you expect if the manager herself is filthy and polluting the food!

They are always slow at this location, it doesn't matter if you do drive thru walk in. On another occasion I did the drive thru and got a burger and 2 apple pies. I ate one pie that had something hard and plastic like in it. I'm definitely sure it wasn't apple or pie crust, so disgusting. I won't ever come here again, McDonald's just keeps getting worse.\n",

      "100.0% Worst McDonalds Ever! I work close so it is convenient for breakfast and lunch, however, after my experience today, I will not be going back. With so many other dining options in the area, I wonder why they don't pay attention to the reviews and step up their game. Today, I went through the drive thru - which is always the slowest around (average of about 5 mins in line - longest time was 11 minutes). Today was the 4th time in a month that I've been through the drive thru and my order was wrong or incomplete. I'm only one person, how many other people does this happen to.This morning, I went to the drive thru about 6:10am, lucky since I was the only one in line. Placed my order, but could tell the person taking my order was distracted. Got to the payment window, where the person dropped my change on the ground, ugh. Next window, pick up food. Here is the entire conversation: Me: Can I get some Mayonnaise and Salt? MD's: Mayonnaise? (as he is chatting with a co-worker and not listening to me.Me: Yes, Mayonnaise and Salt.MD's: OK. (Still chatting it up with co-worker)MD's: That was Mayonnaise and Jelly?Me: No. Mayonnaise and Salt.UGH!! Pay attention! Needless to say, I got to work and order was incomplete. Frustrated, I got back in my car, drove back to restaurant and went inside. Talked to a manager or assistant (couldn't tell, as they had no nametag), but they were very uninterested in the fact that a customer had an issue. I explained that it had happened 4 times in last month, still no reaction. No concern, NO APOLOGY.  He proceeded to get my other item, but was not going to replace the current one I brought back. Since it was now a cold item, I had to ask to get a replacement.I mentioned again that this is the 4th time in a month that this had happened to just me, but again, no apology, no concern, and no reaction. Worst customer service of any restaurant I've ever been in. It seems to me that they need to be reading these reviews and try to improve. I will be sending a copy of this review to McDonald's corporate office, because if they are not already aware of how bad this store is, they need to be.\n",

I stopped into this Mickey D's and right behind the register I saw \"Big Breakfast with Hotcakes.\" Sounded good to me.Just seconds after swiping my credit card, I was handed a tray with three hotcakes (McDonald's pancakes), scrambled eggs, a sausage patty, a biscuit, and a McDonald's hash brown. Oh yeah, and two containers each of syrup and butter. All this for less than five bucks. Now that's what I call fast food. It's fast and it's cheap. This is why America has an obesity problem.Nearing the end of my meal, I started to realize that it was a lot of food. I can eat a lot and I could have probably done OK without the extra hash brown or biscuit (I was also rushing). For three pancakes, I only needed one container of syrup. I like their butter. It's very wispy. Everything was good and tasted consistent with what you'd expect of McDonald's. Out of curiosity, I went to McDonald's web site to see how many calories was in this meal: 1,090.\n",

Then travel back through the parking lot to your get your Mc-Grub without inconveniencing all the people in cars trying to get to work or home.This advice makes much more sense than the numbskulls trying to cut through solid traffic just to get some fast food. And for you people who chose to live in \"hidden cove\" next to, and east of, McDonalds... you have no luck in being able to pull out easily. The traffic is always solid in front of that entrance/exit and you really should have chosen another place to live with easy egress. I know a clue is a lot to ask for these days.\n",

It's super convenient to stop by and grab a quick bite before watching a movie if you don't want to spend a lot of money for food at the theater. But that's pretty much where the pros of this location stop.I've been to this McDonald's several times, but I've been a bit disappointed on several occasions. Most recently, I went through the drive-thru and got a simple order - a McChicken sandwich and small fries. I drove to the Studio Movie Grill parking lot to eat before a movie and noticed that my fries were cold. UGHHHHH... Cold McDonald's fries are the worst. Lame!!!The employees seem to be pretty friendly, and the restaurant looks decent inside. Unfortunately, they lack power outlets (I saw one, but maybe there's a one or two more scattered throughout the restaurant). This makes it inconvenient for people who like to stop by McDonald's to use their laptops, which I do quite often.Overall, this McDonald's deserves about 2.5 stars because it's right in between \"meh\" and \"A-OK.\" I know some may say it's \"just a McDonald's,\" but hey - I've been to numerous other locations where their food is pretty consistent (don't serve COLD fries!) and there are numerous power outlets for customers' use. I'll probably be back just because it's right next to Studio Movie Grill, but I'm hoping they'll start improving the quality of their fast food - at least to the McDonald's standard.[Review 076 of 366]\n",

A tall, large African American man was working the drive thru. When we ordered he never responded over the speaker after waiting 3 minutes. We finally pulled up to the window & the car in front of us entire order was wrong. They had to pull up front & wait. When we made it to the window he asked us \"did you order?\" & we confirmed yes \"he asked what it was\". Once we told him what our order was he said \"for real \". I was floored at the TERRIBLE service of this chain. The service was so bad I took a photo of the phone number posted outside the window to file a complaint. After he confirmed our order (which was only two drinks) we waited at that window another 5 minutes to get the drinks. When we drove off we noticed it was a slu of cars waiting behind us.The guy working the window CLEARLY did not know what he was doing & shouldn't have been working the drive thru.

This store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area. The next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town.

My food comes out decent but they are always out of something everytime I go. I probably will never come to this location again.\n",

      "100.0% On your way to the airport or just cruising down Camp Creek Pkwy? Are you absolutely in Love with McDonald's Sweet Tea? Well then don't ever go through this drive thru. Hands down this is the slowest McDonald's drive thru I've experienced in Atlanta. Considering this location is close to the airport it would be great if they could simply improve the quality of service. As a lover of Sweet Tea, I was completely turned off by this location when I overheard the drive thru operator joking about how sweet it was a few years ago. She told a few of her associates that it was like \"syrup\" and \"liquid diabetes\". By the time I took my first and only sip, I was on I-285 headed to Perimeter Mall and it tasted like cold syrup! Thank goodness for the McDonald's near Perimeter Mall because they refilled my drink. So the moral to the story is, if you're on Camp Creek Pkwy near the airport, bypass McDonald's and head for Chick-fil-A. #EatMoreChicken\n",

      "94.3% It had been a while since I had stopped at this particular one. They have done a total remodel and it looks fairly fresh. Stopped by about 10-11pm and went through drive thru. I thought I'd try a new McWrap. Got a fry and a spicy chick along with that.  I was asked to pull up after sitting at the window for a few minutes and they would bring me my order. That is fine, except about 15 minutes later I'm still waiting. So I go to check what is going on and end up waiting another 5 minutes.  It appeared I wasn't the only one that had a long wait in drive thru as well.  McWrap - I was disappointed. Looked like a wrap that had grilled chicken sprinkle with some mixed greens, then had sweet and sour sauce dumped in it.\n",
