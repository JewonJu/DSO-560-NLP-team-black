So we wait about 5 - 10 minutes for our turn to order.

I came in at 9:30pm and stood in front of the register and no one bothered to say anything or help me for 5 minutes. There was no one else waiting for their food inside either, just outside at the window.  I left and went to Chickfila next door and was greeted before I was all the way inside. This McDonalds is also dirty, the floor was covered with dropped food. Obviously filled with surly and unhappy workers.   \n",

This review reflects solely on the poor service. I have been to this location countless times over the years. They consistently fail on the service end of things. The order takers tend to be rude, no smiles, and a lot of \"sighs\" and \"lip smacking\" when you talk to them. So why go back you ask? This store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area. The next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town. Also I strongly believe in 2nd chances and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100% of the time. I have given them many chances at earning a positive review. I could not recommend this location any less. If you can wait, take a pass. There are better McDonald's stores in Griffin, GA.   \n",

This is primarily because they are so slow. My gosh what exactly is the hold up? It's FAST food people. Also, this morning, I guess the worker thought his mic was off, but it wasn't. I now know that he is trying to get as many hours as possible because he needs money BAD. Spread the word. Anyway, this location is on a little access road and you have to go back the way you came because there is no exit from it at the other end. It would have helped if there was one. So, in the end I think I'll avoid this location and find another. This should be easy as there is no shortage of Mickey D's in this piece.   \n",

I blame management. last day of free coffee so \"we\" decide to stop and order breakfast and coffees thru drive-thru. She charged us for coffee and when asked why she said she needed to confirm there were two of us in the car. Now she has to clear the order and that took retraining. Ask next time at tthe speaker.Oh it gets better....We get to next window where Einstein is waiting, pours the coffees with different creams/sugars added. \"Which one is which?\" I asked... and he smiled and said \"One has 2 cream 2 sugar and the other has 3 cream 1 sugar\".. didnt maek the cups... but at least he made sure we had straws for our coffees.... Hello? management? Where are You?   \n",
       "8  Never been upset about any fast food drive thru service till I came to this McDonalds.After a long trip from California my wife and I went to McDonalds for a quick bite to eat before our drive back home. We pull up to the drive thru but there are a lot of cars waiting to order. We were guessing there must be a lot demand for McDonalds at this late hour. So we wait about 5 - 10 minutes for our turn to order. We order the specials they were having at that time (20 pcs chicken nuggets for $5) and asked for a cup of water because we didn't want to drink any sodas at that late hour. They take our order but tells us they don't serve cups of water there. So we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order. However, we wait for almost another 10 min to finally pay at the first window - then another 5 more min to finally receive our food. By far the worst McDonalds in the world. Unfriendly and slow.   \n",

Usually my order would be wrong every single time so I would not leave that window until I checked every single item. I only hit up fast food once a month or so and it needs to be worth it. Also the fries used to be cold and the cheese on the burger was never melted. Everything was just lukewarm. Now my order has been right a few times in a row and my food hot. Also, I love dining room. Usually you wouldn't find me actually inside a fast food joint but this place has nice flooring, stacked stone, lots of large windows and a flat screen TV usually on HLN. Sometimes its nice to sneak away for a quick weekend breakfast, you know, a little budget and time friendly mommy and me date.   \n",

Considering this location is close to the airport it would be great if they could simply improve the quality of service. As a lover of Sweet Tea, I was completely turned off by this location when I overheard the drive thru operator joking about how sweet it was a few years ago. She told a few of her associates that it was like \"syrup\" and \"liquid diabetes\". By the time I took my first and only sip, I was on I-285 headed to Perimeter Mall and it tasted like cold syrup! Thank goodness for the McDonald's near Perimeter Mall because they refilled my drink.

I went inside, out of respect to show my face that I wasn't trying to scam them, and the manager was working the register. I told him what happened and that I'd like the specialty coffee I originally ordered. He pointed that it had been a week since the original purchase and that he needed proof I wasn't lying about my incorrect order. Mind you, at 6:30am 6 people were all waiting around for their order, which shows slow and poor service. I didn't argue and I walked away leaving my receipt on the counter. I was simply asking for a coffee, not even an entire meal. I don't post about these sort of things, but this time was different. The manager could have easily offered a variety of resolutions, but all he said was \"no I'm sorry\".

      "81.8% TOXIC DUMP! In food quality and employee humanity/work effortTypically, I do NOT eat McDonalds food; yet similar to the experience of others \"trapped\" at Northside Hospital there is no other option if you are hungry outside of the hospital cafeteria hours of operation. Due to a relatives stay and my visits/overnights for 11 weeks~ I too found myself \"trapped\" and therefore forced to buy at McDonalds. Mostly my visits were for coffee or ice cream sundaes. However, last night, for the first time I ordered food (grilled chicken salad) I returned it ~ the meat smelled BADLY. This did not surprise me and only enforced my resolve to avoid chain food restaurants.What did surprise me and absolutely SHOCKED me was the customer service offered by employees ~ HOW in the world can you BE an employee here and NOT for ONE MINUTE or even a second acknowledge the obvious FACT that you work inside a HOSPITAL; then consider what that means for each and every person that approaches your counter to order. HOW you do not SEE them, in FACT that you easily DISMISS them, is beyond my comprehension to understand! HOW you lost your sense of humanity, in all honestly should cause you to pause and contemplate this ~ Are you not aware that you are reflecting how YOU measure within YOU your own sense of dignity?Within my and family/friends of patient at Northside Hospital for the past 11 weeks: each and every time I/they had to place an order I /they was/were subjected to McDonalds toxic business model (in food) which now has transferred (we learned) into their employees. NOT once was I thanked for giving my order; NOT ONCE was I thanked when delivered my order. Yet, at EVERY visit I WAITED and witnessed employee behaviors that were readily displayed and relayed in body language, effort toward actual work, and obvious attitude not only toward me, but guests in front of me. God forbid I happened to have question in reference to the menu (employee response: blank stare, shrug, looking behind them at menu only to turn back around with a blank stare and/or shrug again). God forbid, on separate occasions I happened to ask for a spoon/napkin/straw. Last night, I happened to ask for my drink please (after receiving my salad and waiting for longer than normal) YIKES, you think I had asked him to draw blood!***One more detail regardless if I arrive at 2am, 4am or between 7:30 pm ~ 11 pm this McDonalds is ALWAYS consistently FILTHY! Not just dirty, but FILTHY!Can anyone lift a broom to sweep up the garbage in the service/cooking area; also in the dining room?Can anyone clean the crud surrounding the plastic display case for cookies ALREADY? It's been 11 weeks and that crud is STILL smeared dried; just gross.Wash/disinfect the countertops, payment pads, straw holders, everywhere spills occur; including areas customers touch. EVERY HOUR! Get it? Every single hour! GET a cleaning ONLY employee! This employee will do NOTHING but be THE OCD employee you NEED! Just stop this ATROCIOUSLY DIRTY & DISGUSTING feeding trough you call a restaurant. You should be ashamed.**************************************************Î_**************************************Northside Hospital ~ YOU are responsible for allowing this restaurant to wallow within your walls!

      "100.0% The service at this McDonald's is so bad it's almost comical. Case in point: There was about a two week stretch where I would go to McDonald's every morning before work to get an iced vanilla latte. EVERY day (I kid you not) they got my order wrong and made me a hot latte instead. This would not be a problem, but they questioned me every time if I was sure that was what I ordered. Yes, it even showed it on your fancy digital menu. Then they would ask me to pull up and wait 10 minutes for my order to be corrected. My bf and I went inside once to order and they got his order wrong. The woman just stood there and looked at us when we told her and my bf was like, \"...but I guess I can eat this\". Later when we went up and asked for sauce, she gave us the biggest eyeroll upon seeing us and acted like it was physically painful for her to serve us. These are only a couple of examples of the horrible service we have had, but I guess that's typical for a McDonald's attached to a gas station.\n",

      "100.0% On Christ almighty here it goes. If I am going to eat overpriced McDonalds in a casino I better get what the hell I want to eat. This place is so pitiful just thinking about it makes me angry. I don't even know where to start! Besides Starbucks and Krispy Kreme this is your only option for late night eats at The Excalibur. Here it goes:Visit #1: Fool me once...shame on you.My husband and I head to the room early our first night in Vegas because we were tired after a long drive. After watching some TV my husband said he wanted a little something from our local McDonalds. I was not really hungry but I was craving a little something sweet so I asked him to get me a McFlurry and to call me and tell me what kind they have. He calls and they have Oreo, M&M, and Butterfinger. YUM! I want Butterfinger I exclaimed! He hangs up and calls back about a minute later to break the news to me that they are out of Butterfinger. That would've been useful info to have when he first asked! So I ended up with Oreo. He comes back and I take a bite of my McFlurry. For those who may not know a McFlurry is soft serve icecream mixed with whatever topping you get. How do you possibly mess that up? Messing up a McFlurry is equal to the stupidity of burning cornflakes! There is no excuse. I took one bite and threw it away. The icecream was warm and the oreo chucks were stale. NASTY! My husband's burger and fries turned out ok at least. Visit #2: Fool me twice....shame on me. After some late night gambling I was hungry and did not feel like searching for late night eats so I ventured into this hell hole again. I figured since I was getting regular food this time it would be ok. The customer service of this place is atrocious. You are pretty much the only 24 hour operation that offers more than donuts and coffee so change your attitude. My husband had a sweet tooth this time and wanted a McFlurry. Dun Dun Dun! I order my food and ask for a Oreo McFlurry and the guy behind the counter proceeds to tell me that the icecream machine is locked. Excuse me? WTF? I call my hubby and tell him and he is most displeased. After two minutes of straight cursing he asks for chocolate chip cookies, they have none. The only had oatmeal raisin which I can only describe is the asshole of cookies. So literally they have no good desserts. So my poor baby goes without what he wants. We are not doughnut fans so Krispy Kreme is not really appealing. After that I was done with that place for good!If you are ok with McDonalds go to the one at The Luxor. You will probably get better service. We should've. If you want something better venture into NYNY into America cafe which is open 24 hours and for the same price you can get some decent food and service.\n",

      "100.0% Worst McDonalds Ever! I work close so it is convenient for breakfast and lunch, however, after my experience today, I will not be going back. With so many other dining options in the area, I wonder why they don't pay attention to the reviews and step up their game. Today, I went through the drive thru - which is always the slowest around (average of about 5 mins in line - longest time was 11 minutes). Today was the 4th time in a month that I've been through the drive thru and my order was wrong or incomplete. I'm only one person, how many other people does this happen to.This morning, I went to the drive thru about 6:10am, lucky since I was the only one in line. Placed my order, but could tell the person taking my order was distracted. Got to the payment window, where the person dropped my change on the ground, ugh. Next window, pick up food. Here is the entire conversation: Me: Can I get some Mayonnaise and Salt? MD's: Mayonnaise? (as he is chatting with a co-worker and not listening to me.Me: Yes, Mayonnaise and Salt.MD's: OK. (Still chatting it up with co-worker)MD's: That was Mayonnaise and Jelly?Me: No. Mayonnaise and Salt.UGH!! Pay attention! Needless to say, I got to work and order was incomplete. Frustrated, I got back in my car, drove back to restaurant and went inside. Talked to a manager or assistant (couldn't tell, as they had no nametag), but they were very uninterested in the fact that a customer had an issue. I explained that it had happened 4 times in last month, still no reaction. No concern, NO APOLOGY.  He proceeded to get my other item, but was not going to replace the current one I brought back. Since it was now a cold item, I had to ask to get a replacement.I mentioned again that this is the 4th time in a month that this had happened to just me, but again, no apology, no concern, and no reaction. Worst customer service of any restaurant I've ever been in. It seems to me that they need to be reading these reviews and try to improve. I will be sending a copy of this review to McDonald's corporate office, because if they are not already aware of how bad this store is, they need to be.\n",

      "100.0% TOXIC DUMP! In food quality and employee humanity/work effortTypically, I do NOT eat McDonalds food; yet similar to the experience of others \"trapped\" at Northside Hospital there is no other option if you are hungry outside of the hospital cafeteria hours of operation. Due to a relatives stay and my visits/overnights for 11 weeks~ I too found myself \"trapped\" and therefore forced to buy at McDonalds. Mostly my visits were for coffee or ice cream sundaes. However, last night, for the first time I ordered food (grilled chicken salad) I returned it ~ the meat smelled BADLY. This did not surprise me and only enforced my resolve to avoid chain food restaurants.What did surprise me and absolutely SHOCKED me was the customer service offered by employees ~ HOW in the world can you BE an employee here and NOT for ONE MINUTE or even a second acknowledge the obvious FACT that you work inside a HOSPITAL; then consider what that means for each and every person that approaches your counter to order. HOW you do not SEE them, in FACT that you easily DISMISS them, is beyond my comprehension to understand! HOW you lost your sense of humanity, in all honestly should cause you to pause and contemplate this ~ Are you not aware that you are reflecting how YOU measure within YOU your own sense of dignity?Within my and family/friends of patient at Northside Hospital for the past 11 weeks: each and every time I/they had to place an order I /they was/were subjected to McDonalds toxic business model (in food) which now has transferred (we learned) into their employees. NOT once was I thanked for giving my order; NOT ONCE was I thanked when delivered my order. Yet, at EVERY visit I WAITED and witnessed employee behaviors that were readily displayed and relayed in body language, effort toward actual work, and obvious attitude not only toward me, but guests in front of me. God forbid I happened to have question in reference to the menu (employee response: blank stare, shrug, looking behind them at menu only to turn back around with a blank stare and/or shrug again). God forbid, on separate occasions I happened to ask for a spoon/napkin/straw. Last night, I happened to ask for my drink please (after receiving my salad and waiting for longer than normal) YIKES, you think I had asked him to draw blood!***One more detail regardless if I arrive at 2am, 4am or between 7:30 pm ~ 11 pm this McDonalds is ALWAYS consistently FILTHY! Not just dirty, but FILTHY!Can anyone lift a broom to sweep up the garbage in the service/cooking area; also in the dining room?Can anyone clean the crud surrounding the plastic display case for cookies ALREADY? It's been 11 weeks and that crud is STILL smeared dried; just gross.Wash/disinfect the countertops, payment pads, straw holders, everywhere spills occur; including areas customers touch. EVERY HOUR! Get it? Every single hour! GET a cleaning ONLY employee! This employee will do NOTHING but be THE OCD employee you NEED! Just stop this ATROCIOUSLY DIRTY & DISGUSTING feeding trough you call a restaurant. You should be ashamed.**************************************************Î_**************************************Northside Hospital ~ YOU are responsible for allowing this restaurant to wallow within your walls! How many more years will you ignore not only the unhealthy food options McDonalds supplies~ but to continue to ALLOW a daily dose of DELIBERATE and DILIGENT unhealthy, negative, and \"put upon\" attitudes from employees, to be delivered to family, friends and employees that are there only because they CARE and are there for YOUR patients! HOW this does NOT cause you to react and ACT is beyond me.In my world, with SO MANY options available, this place would be GONE ~ like TODAY; certainly NOT any longer than tomorrow!This toxic waste site is dumping daily doses of negativity, inhumanity~ its seeping and reverberating within the walls of this hospital.

The QT was more than my fish meal so I was told they would refund me the QT and they charged me for the fish meal. Have been checking bank account all weekend no refund. Went back to the store and spoke to manager Starla who told me refunds can take up to two days to go through. It's Tuesday Oct 7th! My payment went through yesterday for two meals purchased Oct 3rd, one of which I didn't eat or take with me. Not happy. Starla tried to make the excuse that yesterday Oct 6th was a holiday. I said \"what holiday\" she says Columbus day. I never had respect for that man but do recognize his holiday is on the 13th for my bank so I informed Starla that yesterday was not a bank holiday. She wouldn't call the GM this evening stating the GM (General Manager) would be there tomorrow between 9to5.

I ate one pie that had something hard and plastic like in it. I'm definitely sure it wasn't apple or pie crust, so disgusting. I won't ever come here again, McDonald's just keeps getting worse.\n",

      "11.6% Never been upset about any fast food drive thru service till I came to this McDonalds.After a long trip from California my wife and I went to McDonalds for a quick bite to eat before our drive back home. We pull up to the drive thru but there are a lot of cars waiting to order. We were guessing there must be a lot demand for McDonalds at this late hour. So we wait about 5 - 10 minutes for our turn to order. We order the specials they were having at that time (20 pcs chicken nuggets for $5) and asked for a cup of water because we didn't want to drink any sodas at that late hour. They take our order but tells us they don't serve cups of water there. So we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order. However, we wait for almost another 10 min to finally pay at the first window - then another 5 more min to finally receive our food. By far the worst McDonalds in the world. Unfriendly and slow.\n",

      "100.0% the worst mcd's I've ever been to. tried to get a quick snack during our long drive and it was the worst decision. the dual lane drive through is anything but fast. one car in front of me but somehow the other lane was the only one moving. some 10 odd minutes later, we finally ordered. one of the cars in front of me obviously knew somebody in the place and just kept talking at the window. it wouldn't have been a big deal if it hadn't continued for so long. after 20+ minutes of sitting in this line, fighting the urge to just drive off, and watching the multiple levels of poor service, we finally got our snack and the freaking fries were cold. I should have taken 2 minutes to read the reviews before I went here and it would have stopped me from ever going. you would think after all that time, at least the food would be hot. HA. just do yourself a favor and find another mcd's to visit. truly a disappointing stop. :-(\n",

      "100.0% Well, it's McDonald's, so you know what the food is. This review reflects solely on the poor service. I have been to this location countless times over the years. They consistently fail on the service end of things. The order takers tend to be rude, no smiles, and a lot of \"sighs\" and \"lip smacking\" when you talk to them. So why go back you ask? This store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area. The next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town. Also I strongly believe in 2nd chances and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100% of the time. I have given them many chances at earning a positive review. I could not recommend this location any less. If you can wait, take a pass. There are better McDonald's stores in Griffin, GA.\n",

I saw the manager filling orders for drive-thru customers using bare hands - no gloves or utensils to pack fries - and this is the weirdest thing ever: she was 'fingering' plastic cup lids!?! Don't know what else to call it! She poked her finger through the plastic cup lids (in the slit made for straws) before inserting straws! What the hell for? Imagine a finger, no gloves, super long nails, painted, and this being inserted into every cup lid before inserting the straw! Why did she need to expose customers to her nails and the shit and germs (nails looked filthy!) underneath? She was using her nails as a tool! The straw can be used to go through the straw slit! No need for a finger nail! FILTHY! I saw this going on inside while the poor folks in drive-thru didn't see this! And the cashier had a bad cold and was wiping his runny nose all over with the back of his hand! What can you expect if the manager herself is filthy and polluting the food! Who knows where her hand'a been?\n",

A tall, large African American man was working the drive thru. When we ordered he never responded over the speaker after waiting 3 minutes. We finally pulled up to the window & the car in front of us entire order was wrong. They had to pull up front & wait. When we made it to the window he asked us \"did you order?\" & we confirmed yes \"he asked what it was\". Once we told him what our order was he said \"for real \". I was floored at the TERRIBLE service of this chain. The service was so bad I took a photo of the phone number posted outside the window to file a complaint. After he confirmed our order (which was only two drinks) we waited at that window another 5 minutes to get the drinks. When we drove off we noticed it was a slu of cars waiting behind us.The guy working the window CLEARLY did not know what he was doing & shouldn't have been working the drive thru.

Cars were honking ferociously behind me. now i'm blocked in. low and behold when i move up, i recognize the guy handing me my food as one of the mcdonald's workers who stepped over my pile of food in slow-motion matrix effect yesterday morning. ughhh! guess they're probably hiring at this fast food establishment and will take any dreggs off the street who either has a pulse or a trust fund, so what's the hurry?

Hands down this is the slowest McDonald's drive thru I've experienced in Atlanta. Considering this location is close to the airport it would be great if they could simply improve the quality of service. As a lover of Sweet Tea, I was completely turned off by this location when I overheard the drive thru operator joking about how sweet it was a few years ago. She told a few of her associates that it was like \"syrup\" and \"liquid diabetes\". By the time I took my first and only sip, I was on I-285 headed to Perimeter Mall and it tasted like cold syrup! Thank goodness for the McDonald's near Perimeter Mall because they refilled my drink.

Oh yeah, and two containers each of syrup and butter. All this for less than five bucks. Now that's what I call fast food. It's fast and it's cheap. This is why America has an obesity problem.Nearing the end of my meal, I started to realize that it was a lot of food. I can eat a lot and I could have probably done OK without the extra hash brown or biscuit (I was also rushing). For three pancakes, I only needed one container of syrup. I like their butter. It's very wispy. Everything was good and tasted consistent with what you'd expect of McDonald's. Out of curiosity, I went to McDonald's web site to see how many calories was in this meal: 1,090.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "100.0% What do you expect? It's a McDonalds. You go here for bad coffee and even worse food. I usually get annoyed when I receive poor service, but I should temper the urge to write about it based on the location and the service they are providing. If you want better service and/or better food, go to a Starbuck and spend a few more pennies. This is just an average run-of-the-mill McDonalds.\n",

      "100.0% It had been a while since I had stopped at this particular one. They have done a total remodel and it looks fairly fresh. Stopped by about 10-11pm and went through drive thru. I thought I'd try a new McWrap. Got a fry and a spicy chick along with that.  I was asked to pull up after sitting at the window for a few minutes and they would bring me my order. That is fine, except about 15 minutes later I'm still waiting. So I go to check what is going on and end up waiting another 5 minutes.  It appeared I wasn't the only one that had a long wait in drive thru as well.  McWrap - I was disappointed. Looked like a wrap that had grilled chicken sprinkle with some mixed greens, then had sweet and sour sauce dumped in it.\n",

      "100.0% Worst McDonalds Ever! I work close so it is convenient for breakfast and lunch, however, after my experience today, I will not be going back. With so many other dining options in the area, I wonder why they don't pay attention to the reviews and step up their game. Today, I went through the drive thru - which is always the slowest around (average of about 5 mins in line - longest time was 11 minutes). Today was the 4th time in a month that I've been through the drive thru and my order was wrong or incomplete. I'm only one person, how many other people does this happen to.This morning, I went to the drive thru about 6:10am, lucky since I was the only one in line. Placed my order, but could tell the person taking my order was distracted. Got to the payment window, where the person dropped my change on the ground, ugh. Next window, pick up food. Here is the entire conversation: Me: Can I get some Mayonnaise and Salt? MD's: Mayonnaise? (as he is chatting with a co-worker and not listening to me.Me: Yes, Mayonnaise and Salt.MD's: OK. (Still chatting it up with co-worker)MD's: That was Mayonnaise and Jelly?Me: No. Mayonnaise and Salt.UGH!! Pay attention! Needless to say, I got to work and order was incomplete. Frustrated, I got back in my car, drove back to restaurant and went inside. Talked to a manager or assistant (couldn't tell, as they had no nametag), but they were very uninterested in the fact that a customer had an issue. I explained that it had happened 4 times in last month, still no reaction. No concern, NO APOLOGY.  He proceeded to get my other item, but was not going to replace the current one I brought back. Since it was now a cold item, I had to ask to get a replacement.I mentioned again that this is the 4th time in a month that this had happened to just me, but again, no apology, no concern, and no reaction. Worst customer service of any restaurant I've ever been in. It seems to me that they need to be reading these reviews and try to improve. I will be sending a copy of this review to McDonald's corporate office, because if they are not already aware of how bad this store is, they need to be.\n",

      "100.0% Worst McDonalds EVER!!!!!!!!!! They are unable to get an order correct, Went through the drive through last night got home and no Fries in my bag. Got to the window and the woman running the window was talking about her personal life with a co worker laughing it up with her back to us making us wait instead of giving us our ice coffee. Then she seemed to remember she was working and brought us our coffee. Last time I went there I ordered something with no mayo which my ticket said... got home and covered in mayo. called up to complain and the response...What do u want me to do about it??? I hope this one goes out of business.... This location is good for nothing, my husband and I if we ever go to another mcdonalds, it will be out of state!\n",

She charged us for coffee and when asked why she said she needed to confirm there were two of us in the car. Now she has to clear the order and that took retraining. Ask next time at tthe speaker.Oh it gets better....We get to next window where Einstein is waiting, pours the coffees with different creams/sugars added. \"Which one is which?\" I asked... and he smiled and said \"One has 2 cream 2 sugar and the other has 3 cream 1 sugar\".. didnt maek the cups... but at least he made sure we had straws for our coffees.... Hello? management? Where are You?\n",

      "93.6% Terrible customer service. I came in at 9:30pm and stood in front of the register and no one bothered to say anything or help me for 5 minutes. There was no one else waiting for their food inside either, just outside at the window.  I left and went to Chickfila next door and was greeted before I was all the way inside. This McDonalds is also dirty, the floor was covered with dropped food. Obviously filled with surly and unhappy workers.\n",

      "100.0% I stopped at this McDonald's because I had about two minutes to grab lunch. The ONLY reason I ever eat at a Mickey D's is because it's a) fast, b) cheap and c) predictable. You know the food won't be awesome, but it will be reasonably eatable. Man, was I disappointed on points b) and c).First, the medium Quarter Pounder meal was more than six bucks. Jeez, that's hardly a deal.What made the sticker shock worse was the poor quality of the food. This had to be the worst Quarter Pounder I've ever (half) eaten. Maybe even the worst fast food burger I've ever had. It looked like it had been sitting out on Uncle Zeke's radiator all morning. The burger patties were gray and curled up at the edges. The bun was dry and crusty. It's like the damn thing was somehow mummified. Just nasty. Too bad I didn't have time to take it back.This will probably be the very last time I ever eat at a McDonald's. It was that bad.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "100.0% The drive thru makes them lost a star since my last review.This is one of those two lane drive thrus, and I know that the function of that is so that the orders are not messed up when you get to the window, but almost everytime, the cashier ends up asking me what did I order. I inquired about that before and was told, that when someone drives off that messes up the order.Well, I guess there's no controlling drive off, and at least I know my order has been confirmed, so it should be right by the time I get to the second window.This McDonald's, also has a late night drive thru Thur - Sat, it use to be a 24 hour on those days, but I don't think it is any longer. One of my biggest pet peeves is that the drive thru staff has no smile in their voice. When you are ordering food from the luxury of your vehicle you want to think that the person in charge of taking your order is in good spirits, but not at this location.\n",

      "100.0% Hot Tip!If you have to go to this location in the mornings, lunch hour or evenings, it is invariable that the Jimmy Carter Blvd and Peachtree Industrial intersection just west of this McDonalds backs up past the entrance to McDonalds...\"SO\"Rather than taking your life in your hands by trying to turn left through three lanes of traffic, simply drive 1,200 feet pass this McDonalds and turn left at the traffic light. Then travel back through the parking lot to your get your Mc-Grub without inconveniencing all the people in cars trying to get to work or home.This advice makes much more sense than the numbskulls trying to cut through solid traffic just to get some fast food. And for you people who chose to live in \"hidden cove\" next to, and east of, McDonalds... you have no luck in being able to pull out easily. The traffic is always solid in front of that entrance/exit and you really should have chosen another place to live with easy egress. I know a clue is a lot to ask for these days.\n",

They were stale and greasy.Just because someone is holding a broom does not mean that they are sweeping. The broom is a prop to make people think they are working while they are socializing with co-workers. They will look at you occasionally while they continue to goof off.

Imagine a finger, no gloves, super long nails, painted, and this being inserted into every cup lid before inserting the straw! Why did she need to expose customers to her nails and the shit and germs (nails looked filthy!) underneath? She was using her nails as a tool! The straw can be used to go through the straw slit! No need for a finger nail! FILTHY! I saw this going on inside while the poor folks in drive-thru didn't see this!

Anyway finally placed order and was told $1.07, which I paid exact price. Here is where its sad...the cashier did not ring up the soda so therefore I did not get a receipt.

Since McDonald's is the only place with a drive-thru on my way to work I stopped by here to grab their special 2 bacon, egg, & cheese biscuits for $2.50. The food was ok, just tasted like you would expect McDonald's food to taste. The service was pretty good at the drive-thru, they were friendly enough.
